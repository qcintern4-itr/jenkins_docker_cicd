BFCC-AIRP-PDF-REPORT-FINDINGS-LINE3-01: Verify that the number of Symptomatic Events in Findings matches the number of manual events in the Include in Report tab in Strip Management after stopping the study
    [Documentation]     Author: Trinh Nguyen
    ...
    ...     Description:
    ...    - This test case ensures that, after a study is stopped, the number of Symptomatic Events (manual events with 'Include in report' enabled) displayed in the Findings section is correct and matches the
    ...    number of events in the Include in report tab in the Strip Management page
    ...
    ...     Precondition:
    ...    - A stopped study with manual events marked as "Include in report"
    ...
    ...     Test Steps:
    ...    1. Stop the study.
    ...    2. Navigate to the PDF Report page.
    ...    3. Scroll to the Findings section and observe the number of Symptomatic Events (line 3).
    ...    4. Navigate to the Strip Management page and view the manual events in the Include in report tab.
    ...    5. Compare the count of events in the Findings section with the Include in report tab in Strip Management.


    ...
    ...     Expected Results:
    ...    1. The number of Symptomatic Events in the Findings section matches the number of events listed in the Include in report tab in Strip Management

BFCC-AIRP-PDF-REPORT-FINDINGS-LINE3-02: Verify that excluding an event from the report in Strip Management reduces the count of Symptomatic Events in Findings
    [Documentation]     Author: Trinh Nguyen
    ...
    ...     Description:
    ...    - This test case verifies that when a manual event is excluded from the report (by unchecking the 'Include event in report' box), the count of Symptomatic
    ...    Events in the Findings section is reduced accordingly after regenerating the findings and report
    ...
    ...     Precondition:
    ...    - A stopped study with at least one manual event included in the report
    ...
    ...     Test Steps:
    ...    1. Navigate to the Strip Management page.
    ...    2. Locate a manual event that is marked as "Include event in report".
    ...    3. Uncheck the 'Include event in report' checkbox for that event.
    ...    4. Navigate to the Report Editing page and click Regenerate Findings.
    ...    5. Regenerate the full PDF report.
    ...    6. Observe the Symptomatic Events count in the Findings section.
    ...
    ...     Expected Results:
    ...    1. The Symptomatic Events count in the Findings section should decrease by one, reflecting the exclusion of the event from the report
